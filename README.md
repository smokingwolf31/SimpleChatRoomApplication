How to run
1. Make sure to extract the contents of this tar.gz file if you have not done that already
2. Place the extracted folder in your desired directory and change/enter to that directory
3. You can now run python3 server.py port_number where port_number represent the port number you want to use for your server to recieve and send messages from. For convinence sake the program will tell your current ip address after you run it.
4. If ther server program is now running you can then run the client program as python3 ip_address port_number where ip_address is the sane ip_address the server supplied to you after running it and the port_number is the same port_number simpplied during the running of the server.
5. When you are done running the client program you are expected to logout.
