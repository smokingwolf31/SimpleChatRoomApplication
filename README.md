Ensure that you have extracted the contents of the tar.gz file if you haven't already.
Place the extracted folder in your desired directory and navigate to that directory.
Run the server program using the command python3 server.py port_number, where port_number represents the desired port for the server to receive and send messages. Assume that you already know the IP address/host name; if not, you can obtain it by running "my addr show."
Once the server program is running, execute the client program with the command python3 ip_address port_number, where ip_address is the same address provided by the server, and port_number is the same port number specified during the server setup.
When you have finished running the client program, remember to log out.
